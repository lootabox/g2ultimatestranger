	Insane metric ton of bug fixes and improvements. He has credits numerous other mods and users, but it's difficult to tell who/what should be credited for what changes due to poor documentation and language barrier. Due to Russian origin all changes had to be manually ported and are documented above in "Ported fixes and improvements".
