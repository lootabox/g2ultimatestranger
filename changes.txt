	Main menu

Menu options are more clearly categorized:
Game: Gameplay settings.
Audio: Music, speech and sound effect settings.
Video: Graphics card, resolution, color adjustment and video settings.
Visual: View distance, details and user interface settings.
Effect: Toggle visual effects on/off.

Settings have been moved around to proper categories and following new settings are available:
Ambient subtitles, Blood detail, Hitpoints per level, Inventory columns, Item effects, Lock scrambling, Mouse smoothing, Play intro, Turning speed, Video scaling, Weapon trails, Window animations.

Default menu option when not ingame is load game instead of new game.
Music is changed to the installation theme.


	Ingame menu

Status menu shows boosted and trained values for Strength and Dexterity.


	Character progression

Only actual training received from NPCs influences how much more can be taught by NPCs. Random increases during dialogues are not counted. This means that any ability increases the NH comes across can be used right away without losing any end game potential.


	Shrine of Innos

Specific gold amounts cannot be donated. Instead for every level gained, up to 60, a donation can be made for an attribute bonus. The amount of gold required depends on donation prayers made and hero level. The bonus is not tied to guilds in any way and the different attributes receive bonuses inline with each other (pseudo random). The first 12 prayers always increase health. In addition the hero can pray without donating for full health or mana once per day.


	Shrine of Beliar

No stats can be sacrificed for gold.


	NPCs

NPCs only loot 20% of gold from NH.
NPCs only loot gold from NH who was caught stealing or by people who are thieves themselves.
NPCs only take the weapon from NH if he was caught doing something violent or threatening.


		MINOR IMPROVEMENTS AND FIXES

	Random

Bloodfly poison is referred to as venom instead.
Cannot level up when dead.
Increased limit for alpha vobs/polys.
Main menu sounds are silenced after start a new game or loading one.
Many items have their description now on one line instead of multiple lines.


	Quests
